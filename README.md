### WebGPU Anisotropic Kuwahara Filter

This is a WebGPU implementation of the anisotropic Kuwahara filter, which is a non-linear image processing technique used for smoothing images while preserving edges. The filter works by dividing the image into small regions and averaging the pixel values within each region, but with a twist: it takes into account the orientation of the edges in the image to produce a more natural-looking result.
